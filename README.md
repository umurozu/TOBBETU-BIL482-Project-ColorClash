# 🎮 Color Clash

**Color Clash** is a web-based, two-dimensional fighting game developed as part of the  
**TOBB ETU – BIL 482 (Design Patterns)** course project.

The project focuses on applying software design patterns within a game-oriented context while maintaining a child-friendly, low-violence gameplay experience.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Color Clash is designed to provide a fun and accessible local multiplayer experience.  
Instead of focusing on complex or violent mechanics, the game emphasizes simplicity, modularity, and extensibility.

The project also serves as a practical case study for applying design patterns in game development.
